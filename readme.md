What
----

This is my first project with Rust. Just finished rustlings so wanted something simple to make.

It is sort of like "ls", but displays the files with full paths by default. This makes it so that in VSCode terminal (and probably other editors) these "paths" become clickable URLs to open files.

It sort of "replaces" my following alias with the same purpose:

```.aliases
e='tree -hfi -I _b -I _b2 -I _b3 -I .git -I deps -I node_modules'
```

Usage
-----

`lizt FOLDER`
